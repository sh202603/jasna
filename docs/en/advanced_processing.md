# Advanced Processing

Optional features for special cases. Everything here works in both the GUI
(look for the matching setting, each has a tooltip) and the CLI.

## Denoising

Restored regions can carry noise artifacts. The Denoising setting
(`--denoise low|medium|high`) applies gentle spatial denoising to the
restored regions only — the rest of the frame is untouched. Start with `low`
and raise it only if artifacts remain.

By default it runs before secondary restoration;
`--denoise-step after_secondary` moves it right before blending.

## Detection stability filtering

Detection is not perfect frame-to-frame: a mosaic can vanish for a frame or
two (cutting one clip into several, with a visible seam and an unrestored
frame), and a single-frame false detection triggers a needless restore.

- **Max Detection Gap** (`--max-detection-gap`, default `2`) fills dropouts
  up to N frames when the mosaic reappears at the same spot, keeping the
  clip continuous.
- **Min Detection Duration** (`--min-detection-duration`, default `2`) drops
  detections shorter than N frames as false positives; those frames stay
  unrestored.

Keep both small so genuine fast appear/disappear moments are unaffected.
`0` disables either.

## 60 FPS to 30 FPS export

For 60 (or 59.94) FPS input, **Reduce 60 FPS to 30 FPS**
(`--retarget-high-fps`) processes every second frame and writes 30 (or
29.97) FPS output — half the processing work. Audio timing and playback
speed are preserved. Other frame rates are unchanged:

```bash
jasna --input input.mp4 --output output.mp4 --retarget-high-fps
```

Cannot be combined with [segment processing](segments.md).

## Color LUT

Apply a `.cube` color LUT (1D or 3D) to the output — for color grading or
matching a house look. Set it in the GUI's Encoding section or with
`--lut path/to/look.cube`. The LUT is applied on the GPU just before
encoding, so it costs almost nothing.

## Custom encoder settings

The **Encoder custom args** field (`--encoder-settings`) fine-tunes the
hardware video encoder — quality level, bitrate caps, keyframe interval, and
more. The main knob is `cq` (lower = better quality, bigger file):

```bash
jasna --input in.mp4 --output out.mkv --encoder-settings "cq=22"
```

Every accepted key for every codec is documented in the
[CLI reference](cli.md#encoding).

## Fragmented MP4 (fMP4)

`.mp4` / `.mov` output is normally unplayable until the run finishes: the moov
atom — the codec setup plus an index of every sample — is written only when the
container is closed. `--fmp4` writes a fragmented MP4 (fMP4) instead, so the
growing file can be opened and played mid-run, audio included, and stays
playable if the run is interrupted:

```bash
jasna --input input.mp4 --output output.mp4 --fmp4
```

Internally the movflags change from `+faststart` to `+frag_keyframe+empty_moov`:
a sample-free moov lands at the head of the file immediately, and media follows
as per-keyframe `moof` + `mdat` fragments, each carrying the sample table for its
own `mdat`. The playable range grows every time a fragment completes. Fragment
granularity follows the keyframe interval — with the NVENC default (`g=250`),
roughly every 8 s at 30 FPS.

The in-progress file's moov carries no total duration, so players may show an
incomplete duration and seek imprecisely until the run finishes, and very old
players may not support fragmented MP4. The flag is ignored with `--stream` and
[segment processing](segments.md), and has no effect on `.mkv` output.

## Post-export actions

Run something when the whole queue finishes: **Shutdown PC** or a **custom
command** (for example, a notification script). Set it in the GUI's
Post-export section or via CLI:

```bash
jasna --input input.mp4 --output output.mkv --post-export-action shutdown
jasna --input folder_in --output folder_out --post-export-action command --post-export-command "echo done"
```
