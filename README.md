# <img width="32" src="https://github.com/Kruk2/jasna/blob/main/assets/jasna-logo.png?raw=true" /> Jasna 

Jasna is a JAV mosaic restoration tool with a simple GUI, a CLI, a GPU-only processing pipeline, NVIDIA TensorRT and experimental AMD ROCm support, optional secondary restoration models, still-image restoration, and streaming support.

Jasna is free. Supporters get a key that unlocks the extra models trained for this project: the **unet-4x** secondary upscaler and the experimental **SD 1.5 image restoration** model. See [Supporting the project](#supporting-the-project).

> ### ⚙️ This is the `+modi` fork of Jasna

> - **Scope — public (free) features only.** The supporter models (**unet-4x** and **SD 1.5 image restoration**) ship as encrypted checkpoints unlocked by a supporter key, and the decryption code lives in a private submodule that is **not part of this public fork** — so those models **cannot be downloaded, decrypted, or run here**. The upstream code for them rides along but stays inert. If you want the supporter models, use upstream [**Kruk2/jasna**](https://github.com/Kruk2/jasna) and become a supporter. Everything else (detection, video restoration, RTX/TVAI secondary, the segment editor, VR180, post-export actions, frame generation) works normally.

## What Jasna Does

- Restores mosaics in video files.
- Restores mosaics in still images with the experimental SD 1.5 image model.
- Detects mosaics with the fast `rfdetr-v6` model by default; the larger RF-DETR variant and Lada and ZeLeFans YOLO models are also available.
- Processes side-by-side VR180 videos per eye and automatically picks the best mosaic restoration handling for each studio; the Segment Editor can preview the options.
- Supports frame-accurate ranges, restoration previews, and zoom/pan inspection in the Segment Editor.
- Reduces clip-boundary flicker with temporal overlap and crossfade.
- Detects hard scene cuts and ends tracked clips at the boundary, so restoration never blends content across a cut.
- Can further improve quality with optional [secondary restoration models](docs/en/models.md#secondary-restoration) — **unet-4x**, **RTX Super Resolution**, or **Topaz Video AI** — which sharpen restored regions, especially large mosaics, close-ups, and 4K video.
- Can stream restored video to the built-in browser player or a supported Stash fork.

## `+modi` Additions

These features are exclusive to the `+modi` fork. See [docs/CHANGES_vs_upstream_en.md](docs/CHANGES_vs_upstream_en.md) for the full list of changes against upstream.

### Frame Generation (frame-rate up-conversion)

`--frame-gen {2x,4x}` raises the output frame rate by inserting AI-interpolated frames (RIFE) between the source frames. File output only (not `--stream`, not `--segments`); audio timecodes are kept, so duration and sync are preserved. Runs fp16 by default — measured ~1.9x faster than fp32 (1080p 2x, RTX 5060 Ti) with visually identical output.

```bash
jasna --input input.mp4 --output output.mkv --frame-gen 2x
```

Backend via `--frame-gen-backend {rife,rtx}` (`rife` is the default and available now; `rtx` is pending NVIDIA's `nvidia-vfx` release).

A standalone `jasna-framegen` command applies **only** frame generation to an already-restored video (no detection/restoration) — handy for a two-pass workflow (restore first, e.g. with the official binary, then up-convert). It also supports folder input/output with an `--output-pattern` naming template (videos only):

```bash
jasna-framegen --input restored.mkv --output out2x.mkv --factor 2x
jasna-framegen --input in_dir --output out_dir --factor 2x --output-pattern "{original}_2x.mkv"
```

Details: [docs/FRAME_GENERATION_en.md](docs/FRAME_GENERATION_en.md).

### Video Backend (experimental)

Jasna decodes and encodes through PyAV (NVDEC/NVENC) by default (`--video-backend native`). An **experimental** [torchcodec](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/torchcodec) backend is available as an alternative:

```bash
jasna --input input.mp4 --output output.mkv --video-backend auto
```

`--video-backend {native,auto,torchcodec}` (default `native`, i.e. unchanged behavior): `auto` uses torchcodec for **decode** where available and falls back to native otherwise; `torchcodec` forces it. `--decode-backend` / `--encode-backend` override each side independently. Since v0.8.0 the native encoder always outputs 10-bit HEVC/AV1, which torchcodec's 8-bit NVENC cannot match, so **torchcodec encode runs only when forced** (`--encode-backend torchcodec`), and only for 8-bit sources with mappable NVENC settings; streaming, `--segments`, `--retarget-high-fps`, and frame generation stay on native. Colorspace metadata is preserved either way. Requires the optional dependency (`pip install "torchcodec>=0.14.0"` from the cu130 wheel index). Details: [docs/TORCHCODEC_BACKEND_en.md](docs/TORCHCODEC_BACKEND_en.md).

### FP8 Restoration Backend (experimental)

`--fp8-recon` runs the BasicVSR++ upsample stage as cuDNN FP8 convolutions instead of the TensorRT FP16 sub-engine:

```bash
jasna --input input.mp4 --output output.mp4 --fp8-recon
```

The main benefit is VRAM: the TensorRT upsample engine's load-time arena (~2.2 GB at the default `--max-clip-size 90`) is never allocated, measured as 1.2–1.7 GB lower peak VRAM across 480p–4K clips. The stage itself also runs ~1.5x faster, though end-to-end fps is unchanged because the pipeline is detection-bound. Output stays visually indistinguishable from the FP16 engine and is bit-deterministic across runs. Requires an FP8-capable GPU (sm89+, i.e. RTX 40 series or newer; the speedup is validated on Blackwell only) and fp16 mode; falls back to the TensorRT engine on any failure. Verified on both Linux and Windows. Details: [docs/FP8_RECON_en.md](docs/FP8_RECON_en.md).

### FlashVSR secondary restoration (experimental)

`--secondary-restoration flashvsr` upscales each restored 256px mosaic crop to 1024px (4x) with [FlashVSR](https://github.com/OpenImagingLab/FlashVSR) diffusion VSR, recovering texture the primary model leaves blurry on large mosaics, close-ups, and 4K:

```bash
jasna --input in.mp4 --output out.mkv --secondary-restoration flashvsr --flashvsr-repo ~/FlashVSR_plus
```

FlashVSR peaks at 12–16 GB VRAM on its own, so it cannot co-reside with the ~9 GB primary pipeline. It runs **offline in three subprocesses whose peak VRAM never overlaps**: (1) primary restoration → serialize crops to a disk *bundle*, (2) FlashVSR 4x under its own venv, (3) re-blend + encode the final output. You supply the `FlashVSR_plus` checkout, its v1.1 weights, and a **uv-managed standalone Python venv** (system Python can't JIT FlashVSR's Triton attention kernel). File-output only; not compatible with `--stream` / `--frame-gen`. A single-pass variant, `--secondary-restoration flashvsr-inline`, runs FlashVSR inside the streaming pipeline with **no intermediate files** (needs a 16 GB card and a checkout with the tiny-long multi-chunk patch). Details: [docs/FLASHVSR_en.md](docs/FLASHVSR_en.md).

## Community

Join the [SLS Discord](https://discord.gg/uNwQ4mHqgv) for examples, support, and settings discussion. Please don't be too weird.

## Requirements

- An NVIDIA **GTX 16-series / RTX 20-series or newer** GPU. GTX 10-series and older cards (GTX 1050/1060/1070/1080) won't work. Not sure about yours? Check NVIDIA's [GPU table](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/gpus) — compute capability 7.5+ is required.
- Nvidia driver **610 or newer** on Windows, **580 or newer** on Linux.
- AMD support is experimental and needs a ROCm-supported GPU.
- Install Jasna into a folder whose path contains only English letters and numbers.

Jasna manages VRAM automatically: when it runs low, waiting frames are temporarily moved to system RAM. No configuration needed.

## Quick Start

1. Download the release package for your OS and GPU vendor.
2. Unzip it into a folder with only English characters in the path.
3. Start the app:
   - Windows: double click `jasna.exe`.
   - Linux NVIDIA: run the `jasna` file.
   - Linux AMD: run `run_jasna_amd.sh`.
4. Add a video or image, choose settings, and start processing.

Every setting in the GUI has a tooltip — hover the ⓘ icon next to it. The
[GUI guide](docs/en/gui.md) tours the rest: queue reordering, presets, output
patterns, and more.

Prefer the command line?

```bash
# Single video
jasna --input input.mp4 --output output.mkv

# Still image
jasna --input photo.png --output restored.png

# Whole folder
jasna --input input_folder --output output_folder
```

Run `jasna --help` for all options, or read the [CLI reference](docs/en/cli.md).

## First Run

The first run is slow because Jasna prepares GPU-specific files for your exact card. On NVIDIA this usually takes **15-60 minutes**; on AMD the preparation is much shorter. It only happens once — the results are cached in `model_weights` and reused on every later run. You can copy them from an older Jasna version to a newer one.

Close other applications, including browsers, and avoid using the PC while this runs.

If you run out of VRAM during processing, reduce **max clip size** first, for example from `180` to `60`. See [Tuning VRAM and GPU usage](docs/en/tuning.md).

## Benchmarks

End-to-end restoration measured on Linux with an RTX 5090 (driver 595.84) and
i9-13900K.
Jasna used its default models with `--max-clip-size 180 --temporal-overlap 15
--secondary-restoration none`. Lada Flatpak 0.11.0 used the accurate `v2`
detector, CUDA FP16, `--max-clip-length 180`, and its NVIDIA HEVC HQ preset.
Frozen-release and Lada times are one measured run after a discarded warmup;
v0.9.0 and v0.9.1 times are medians of three interleaved runs after warmup.
Parenthetical ratios use Lada as the baseline; because Lada was not run on 8K,
that row uses v0.9.0 as its baseline. The SONE clips contain 6,056 frames
(3:22) each and the 8K VR clip 900 frames (15 s).

Only the releases where speed or GPU memory actually moved are listed, and one
input per resolution. Every version and every codec is in the
[full benchmark report](benchmarks/2026-07-26_release_matrix.md).

| Input | Lada 0.11.0 v2 | v0.4.1 | v0.5.0 | v0.9.0 (4a171c9) | **v0.9.1 (18add8a)** |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 720p H.264 8-bit | 01:47 (baseline) | 01:35 (1.1x faster) | 00:45 (2.4x faster) | 00:34 (3.1x faster) | **00:32 (3.4x faster)** |
| 1080p H.264 8-bit | 02:02 (baseline) | 01:46 (1.2x faster) | 00:47 (2.6x faster) | 00:39 (3.2x faster) | **00:34 (3.6x faster)** |
| 2160p H.264 8-bit | 04:56 (baseline) | 03:23 (1.5x faster) | 01:22 (3.6x faster) | 01:15 (3.9x faster) | **01:03 (4.7x faster)** |
| 8K VR HEVC 8-bit 60 fps | — | — | — | 00:34 (8K baseline) | — |

GPU memory is median/peak GiB for the measured benchmark target; `—` means
not run. Parenthetical ratios compare the median against v0.4.1, or against
v0.9.0 on the 8K row that v0.4.1 never ran. Lada is left out of the comparison:
it uses less GPU memory than any Jasna build.

| Input | Lada | v0.4.1 | v0.5.0 | v0.9.0 | **v0.9.1** |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 720p H.264 8-bit | 1.8/3.1 | 17.6/19.9 (baseline) | 8.6/9.0 (2.0x less) | 8.6/9.1 (2.0x less) | **4.2/4.6 (4.2x less)** |
| 1080p H.264 8-bit | 2.0/3.3 | 18.9/21.4 (baseline) | 9.5/10.2 (2.0x less) | 9.3/10.1 (2.0x less) | **4.8/5.6 (3.9x less)** |
| 2160p H.264 8-bit | 2.6/4.1 | 26.0/30.5 (baseline) | 12.9/15.0 (2.0x less) | 11.4/15.4 (2.3x less) | **7.2/10.9 (3.6x less)** |
| 8K VR HEVC 8-bit 60 fps | — | — | — | 17.1/18.3 (8K baseline) | — |

The v0.9.1 drop in GPU memory comes from building the restoration sub-engines
at fixed batch sizes instead of at the clip size — see the
[engine batch report](benchmarks/2026-07-28_engine_batch_vram.md). For
median/peak RAM, methodology, raw data, and performance-commit comparisons see
the [full benchmark report](benchmarks/2026-07-26_release_matrix.md).

### Legacy full-video benchmarks

The original Linux results are retained below and enriched with the new
v0.7.2 and v0.9.0 runs. They used the same RTX 5090 and i9-13900K; the listed
clip size was preserved for each input.
